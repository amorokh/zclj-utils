# zclj-utils

A repository of Clojure(Script) reusable snippets.

## Usage

The purpose of this repository is to collect utils and common patterns and make them easy to reuse by COPY-PASTE. Enabling reuse by Copy-Paste will relieve you of having a library dependency with a lot of functionality that would not be used. Instead copy the code that fits your use case and paste it into your project.

There will be some duplication among the files since to have a good copy-paste experience every file should be self contained.

My hope is that this approach will lead to code that is easy to delete and to not create dependencies where none where needed.
